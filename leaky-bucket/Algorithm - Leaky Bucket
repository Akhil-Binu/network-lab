Algorithm - Leaky Bucket

Step 1: Input the bucket size, outgoing rate, and no of inputs
Step 2: While n is not equal to 0,
Step 3: Input the incoming packet size
Step 4: Print the incoming packet size
Step 5: If the incoming packet size is less than or equal to the bucket size - store,
Step 6: Add the incoming packet size to the store
Step 7: Print the bucket buffer size and the store
Step 8: Subtract the outgoing rate from the store
Step 9: If the store is less than 0,
Step 10: Set the store to 0
Step 11: Print the after outgoing packets left out of the bucket buffer size and the store
Step 12: Subtract 1 from n
Step 13: End while
Step 14: End program

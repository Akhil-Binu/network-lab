Algorithm - TCP


Client
1. Create a socket
2. Connect the socket to the server
3. Read the string to be reversed from the standard input and send it to the server
Read the matrices from the standard input and send it to the server using the socket
4. Read the reversed string from the socket and display it on the standard output
Read the product matrix from the socket and display it on the standard output
5. Close the socket


Server

1. Create a listening socket
2. bind IP address and port number to the socket
3. listen for incoming requests on the listening socket
4. accept the incoming request
5. connection socket is created when accepting returns
6. Read the string using the connection socket from the client
7. Reverse the string
8. Send the string to the client using the connection socket
9. close the connection socket
10. close the listening socket

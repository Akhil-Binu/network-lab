Link-State Routing Algorithm:

(It is the Dijkstra algorithm. This algorithm finds the shortest (least cost paths) from the source u to
every other node in the network.
D(v): cost of the least cost path from the source node to the destination node v as of this iteration of the
algorithm
p(v): previous node of v along the current least cost path from the source to v
N': a subset of nodes. v is in N'
if the least cost path from the source to v is definitely known

Initialization :
N' = {u}

for all nodes v
    if v is a neighbor of u
        then D(v) = c(u,v)
    else
        D(v) = âˆž
do {
    find w, not in N'
    such that D(w) is a minimum
    add w to N'
    update D(v) for each neighbor v of w and not in N'.

    D(v) = min{D(v) , D(w) + c(w,v)}
} while ( N'!= N)
